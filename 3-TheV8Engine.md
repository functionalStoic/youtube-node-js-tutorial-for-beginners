# JavaScript Engines

- Computers do not understand JavaScript
- A JavaScript engine takes JavaScript, and converts it into something it does understand
- machine code

## Machine Code

- JavaScript
- C++ - Highly Abstracted - Node.js is written in C++
- Assembly Language - next level up
- MachineCode - most basic

## So

- Node.js is written in C++
- At the heart of Node.js is the V8 engine
- The V8 engine converts our JS into machine code

## Node.js with V8

- JavaScript
- C++ Node.js V8
- Machine Code
